# ArknightsOnLinuxTutorial

Hi there, once I find the time, I will document here, on I set up Arknights on Linux, update it, how to fix potential bugs and set up keybinds.

This can all be done **without** a Google account, however you won't be able to do purchases.

In short, I used waydroid with waydroid script and KeyMapper.
